# overview 

The dataset contains **785,741 job postings** with **17 columns** covering job titles, locations, posting dates, company names, skills, and limited salary information. It includes categorical variables (e.g., job title, location, company), boolean flags (remote work, degree requirement, health insurance), numeric fields (average annual and hourly salaries), and a datetime column for posting dates.

Most columns are nearly complete, but some have significant missing values: salary information is sparse (`salary_rate` \~4%, `salary_year_avg` \~2.8%, `salary_hour_avg` \~1.3%), and skills are available for \~85% of postings.

The dataset is well suited for analyzing **job market trends, in-demand skills, geographic distribution, and remote work patterns**, but less reliable for detailed salary benchmarking due to missing data.

```
### Filtering:
Here I have filtered only the data taken from Egypt only.

```df_Egy= df[df['job_country']=='Egypt']```

# The Analysis
## 1.What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

The analysis focused on job postings in Egypt extracted from the larger global dataset. The data was filtered to include only Egyptian postings and the skills associated with each role were expanded so that individual skills could be counted. The dataset was then grouped by job title and skill to identify the most frequently requested skills for different positions. For visualization, the top three job titles—Data Analyst, Data Engineer, and Data Scientist—were selected, and the top five skills within each category were plotted to highlight both absolute counts and relative percentages.

[2_skills_count.ipynb](3_project/2_skills_count.ipynb)

### Visualize data 
```py
fig, ax= plt.subplots(len(job_titles),1)



for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot=df_skills_count[df_skills_count['job_title_short'] == job_title].head()
    sns.barplot(data=df_plot, x='skills_count',y='job_skills',palette='mako',ax=ax[i])
    ax[i].set_ylabel(job_title)
    ax[i].set_xlim(0, 250)
     
     # Calculate percentages
    total = df_plot['skills_count'].sum()
    df_plot['percentage'] = df_plot['skills_count'] / total * 100

        # Annotate each bar with percentage
    for p, perc in zip(ax[i].patches, df_plot['percentage']):
        width = p.get_width()
        ax[i].text(
            width + 0.5,                      # position (a bit to the right of bar)
            p.get_y() + p.get_height() / 2,   # center of the bar
            f'{perc:.1f}%',                   # format the percentage
            va='center'
        )

plt.tight_layout()
sns.despine()
```

### Results
![visualization](3_project/outputs/2_skills_count_output.png)

### Insights

The results show that Python and SQL are the two most consistently demanded skills across all three roles, forming the foundation of data-related jobs in Egypt.

- Data Analysts primarily rely on SQL, Excel, and visualization tools (Tableau, Power BI), with Python also playing a significant role.

- Data Engineers emphasize Python and SQL, but also require big data tools (Spark, Kafka) and cloud technologies (AWS).

- Data Scientists demonstrate the strongest reliance on Python and SQL, with Tableau and R adding value for statistical and visualization tasks, and Spark appearing for large-scale data processing.

Overall, the Egyptian job market highlights a strong demand for core programming and database skills while differentiating between roles through specialized requirements: visualization and business tools for Analysts, big data and cloud infrastructure for Engineers, and a combination of statistical methods and large-scale processing for Scientists.

## 2.How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?

I transformed the data by breaking job skills into separate rows, counting how often each skill appeared per month, ranking them by total demand, and converting month numbers to names. Then I calculated the percentage demand of each skill per month and visualized the top 3 skills (SQL, Python, Excel) in a line chart with markers, percentages on the y-axis, and clear labels to show their monthly trends.

### Insights

* **SQL**
  SQL is consistently the **most in-demand skill** for Data Analysts in Egypt. It peaks above **45% in April and July**, showing strong reliance on database querying skills. Despite fluctuations, SQL remains the top requirement across the year.

* **Python**
  Python demand shows more **volatility** but nearly **matches SQL in July and December**. This suggests Python is increasingly critical for analytical and automation tasks, and employers are seeking candidates with advanced programming capabilities alongside SQL.

* **Excel**
  Excel demonstrates **steady but lower demand** compared to SQL and Python, averaging **20–35%**. Its dip around September followed by recovery toward the year’s end shows it is still a **foundational tool**, but less central than SQL and Python for analyst roles.

## 3.How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?

In this project, I analyzed job market data in Egypt with a focus on data-related roles. I examined the most in-demand skills by grouping and counting their occurrences, visualized the top five skills for each job title using bar charts, and compared skill frequency with salary levels through scatter plots. I also explored job benefits, work-from-home opportunities, and job degree requirements by applying value counts and visualizations. Throughout the process, I used Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to clean, aggregate, and represent the data, which provided clear insights into hiring trends and skill demands in the Egyptian market.

The first table shows specialized technical skills (e.g., Git, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch, Linux, and MATLAB) that are associated with very high median salaries in Egypt, often exceeding $150K per year. However, most of these skills appear only once or twice in the dataset, which means they may represent niche roles or outlier postings rather than consistent market trends.

The second table presents more common skills such as Python, SQL, Excel, and R, which appear more frequently in job postings. These skills have lower median salaries (around $70K–$90K) compared to the niche skills but are much more widely demanded. This suggests that while specialized technologies can command higher pay, core skills like Python and SQL remain the foundation for employability and are crucial for most data-related positions.

## 4.What is the most optimal skill to learn for Data Analysts?

The next Python code analyzes data on data analyst jobs in Egypt, focusing on the relationship between skills, salary, and job demand. Initially, the code loads job posting data and cleans it by converting the 'job_posted_date' to a datetime object and the 'job_skills' column from a string representation to a list. It then filters the dataset to include only Data Analyst roles in Egypt that have a specified yearly salary. The skills data is then prepared for analysis by creating an exploded DataFrame, where each row represents a single skill. The analysis calculates the median salary for each skill and the demand percentage, which represents how often a particular skill appears in the job postings. Finally, a bar plot is generated to visualize the top 15 skills, showing their median yearly salary and a text label indicating their demand percentage, offering insights into which skills are most valuable and in demand for data analysts in Egypt.
